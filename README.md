# Abstract Algebra Library

A recreational attempt at a library for abstract algebra.

Current working structures:
- Groups (predicate based inclusion)
- Finite Groups (list based inclusion, with conversions to predicate based groups)

Future plans include adding:
- Rings (predicate based inclusion)
- Fields (predicate based inclusion)
- Normal Groups (predicate and/or list based inclusions)
- Ideals (predicate and/or list based inclusion)
- Various fundamental theorems

A subfolder (durbin) selects questions from Durbin's "Modern Algebra", for testing and POC.
