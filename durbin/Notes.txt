* Section 5 : Group Definitions
  The early chapters use instances of raitonals, reals,
  and other set that are currently out of scope
  from the type theory perspective. While generalized
  algebraic properties will be feasible in CiC,
  being able to prove instances and/or properties
  of families of instances will require a deeper dive.
  As such, many questions have been skipped... for now.
